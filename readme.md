## 🔎 Features 🔎
1. **The user can make a recording**
which is then transcribed using AI, without correction. This allows the user to discover the mistakes made by this AI. For this I will use the AI ​​model Whisper-Large-v2, which is one of the better models.

2. **The user can compare different AI models with each other.**
This allows them to compare how the models perform compared to each other

3. **The user can compare other people's results.**
For this I will use a dataset with users who all speak the same piece of text. The user can compare the results.

4. **The user can watch a video with uncorrected transcription.** 
Normally this is corrected, but I will apply this without correction which will allow the user to see how many mistakes AI makes for different speakers.
